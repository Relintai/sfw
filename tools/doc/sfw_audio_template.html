	LICENSE
	  Public domain. See "unlicense" statement at the end of this file.

  ABOUT
    A simple stereo audio mixer which is capable of mixing samples and audio streams.
    Samples can be played with different gain, pitch and panning.
    Streams can be played with different gain.
    This library has no malloc/free. All structs have to be "prepared" by the user. So you can enroll your own memory management.
    You have to implement/provide a real audio-backend to hear something from the speakers.
    A good starting point would be SDL2 where you can use an audio callback to feed the audio device.
