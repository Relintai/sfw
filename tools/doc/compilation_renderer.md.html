You have 3 files: `sfw.h` and `sfw.cpp`, and `sfw_3rd.m` (this is actually a c header file, it has 
the extencion `.m` to make OSX builds easier).

Note: You might need to set c++14 level compatibility depending on your compiler. While the codebase is somwhere between 
c++89 and c++11, threads use classes from the std namespace that were added in c++14. Nowadays these are usually available 
without any special setting, but if your compiler is older (or set differently) you might need to add something like: 
`-std=c++14` to your compile commands. (Or find a setting similar in your IDE.)

## IDE Setup

If you use an ide, first add these files to your project (so the .cpp file gets compiled).
If it doesn't like the `.m` file (it's actually a c header), you can skip adding it to your project,
but you will need it sitting there.

If you are using MSVC as your compiler (you are using Visual Studio) then you are done.
You should be able to compile your project.

If you are using MingW (If you use the g++ command on windows, that is MingW!), then
find a section in your ide that says something similar to `link to libraries`. Usually
is't under a linker settings section, and add the following entries: `gdi32`, `Shlwapi`, `ws2_32`.

If you use linux (g++ or clang) then find a section in your ide that says something similar to 
`link to libraries`. Usually is't under a linker settings section, and add the following entry: `X11`.

If you are on OSX, then you need set your ide to use clang++, you ned to set it to use the c++14 standard,
also you need to add the following osx sdk frameworks to be able to build: `cocoa`, `iokit`, `CoreFoundation`, 
`CoreAudio`, `AudioToolbox`.

## Manual setup

### MSVC (Windows)

If you want to use this compiler from your terminal, you need to install Visual Studio, and also install 
the c++ tools with it.

After this is done, to be able to use it from a terminal you need to run a `vcvarsall.bat` that comes 
with the install localed in 
`C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build`. This script set up environment
variables in your terminal to be able to build.

If you want to build 64 bit programs, you run:

`"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" amd64`

You can put it like this in a batch file:

```
if not defined DevEnvDir (
	call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" amd64
)
```

If you are using the compiler directly, then just add `sfw.cpp` to the list of files that you are compiling:

```
cl /Zi /EHsc /Feprog-vc.exe sfw.cpp main.cpp
```

Note: /Zi means add debug information to the executable.

If you are creating object files:

```
cl /EHsc /Zi /c sfw.cpp /Fo:sfw.obj
cl /EHsc /Zi /c main.cpp /Fo:main.obj

cl /Zi /EHsc /Feprog-vc.exe sfw.obj main.obj
```

If you are using MSVC you don't need to link to anything, as MSVC has a nice feature where 
this can be done automatically. Search the codebase for `#pragma comment` to see the libraries that get linked.

### MingW

Note If you use the g++ command on windows, that is MingW!

If you are using a compiler directly, then just add `sfw.cpp` to the list of files that you are compiling, and 
also link to `gdi32`, `Shlwapi`, `ws2_32`.

```
g++ -g sfw.cpp main.cpp -lgdi32 -lShlwapi -lws2_32 -o prog 
```

If you are creating object files:

```
g++ -g -c sfw.cpp -o sfw.o
g++ -g -c main.cpp -o main.o

g++ -g sfw.o main.o -lgdi32 -lShlwapi -lws2_32 -o prog
```

Note: -g means add debug information to the executable.

Note the position of the `-l` commands, add those after your object (or .cpp) files.

Also, you don't need to add these to the other steps that does not create the final executable.

Note if you use clang, just replacing `g++` to `clang++` or `clang` should work.

### Linux (G++ / clang)

On debian based distributions run the following command to make sure that dependencies are installed:

```
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxi-dev
```

Arch based systems should have these by default. For other distros consult the manual and / or the internet
to see which packages are the equivalent of the ones listed above.


This is how your last (linking) command changes:

```
g++ -g sfw.cpp main.cpp -lX11 -o prog 
```

Or

```
g++ -g -c sfw.cpp -o sfw.o
g++ -g -c main.cpp -o main.o

g++ -g sfw.o main.o -lX11 -o prog
```

Note the position of the `-l` command, add those after your object (or .cpp) files.

Some g++ versions seem a lot more leanient, for example on Manjaro as of this writing 
`g++ -g -lX11 sfw.o main.o -o prog` works, but on the Raspberry pi (Raspian) it doesn't.

Also, you don't need to add these to the other steps that does not create the final executable.

Note if you use clang, just replacing `g++` to `clang++` or `clang` should work.

### OSX (clang)

If you need the renderer you will need to use clang on OSX.

First we need to setup SDK paths:

```
export SDKROOT=$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)
```

Set up some helper variables: 

```
export cpp_args="-std=c++14 -w -framework cocoa -framework iokit -framework CoreFoundation -framework CoreAudio -framework AudioToolbox "
export m_args="-w -framework cocoa -framework iokit -framework CoreFoundation -framework CoreAudio -framework AudioToolbox "
```

On OSX sfw_3rd.m need to be compiled manually, separately:

(This is a workaround, because Objective-C and C++ code doesn't mix in a single file, but Objective-C and C does.)

```
clang++ -w $m_args -g -c sfw_3rd.m -o sfw_3rd.o
```

Now just compile everything else to objects:

```
clang++ $cpp_args -g -c sfw.cpp -o sfw.o
clang++ $cpp_args -g -c game_scene.cpp -o game_scene.o
clang++ $cpp_args -g -c main.cpp -o main.o
```

Then just link them together:

```
clang++ $cpp_args -g sfw.o sfw_3rd.o game_scene.o main.o -o game 
```
