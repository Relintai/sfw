You have 2 files: `sfw.h` and `sfw.cpp` or `sfwl.h` and `sfwl.cpp` depending on your choice.

Note: You might need to set c++14 level compatibility depending on your compiler. While the codebase is somwhere between 
c++89 and c++11, threads use classes from the std namespace that were added in c++14. Nowadays these are usually available 
without any special setting, but if your compiler is older (or set differently) you might need to add something like: 
`-std=c++14` to your compile commands.

## IDE Setup

If you use an ide, just add these files to your project (so the .cpp file gets compiled), and you are done.

## Manual setup

### g++ / mingw:

If you are using a compiler directly, then just add `sfw.cpp` or `sfwl.cpp` to the list of files that you are compiling:


```
g++ -g sfw.cpp main.cpp -o prog 
```

Note: -g means add debug information to the executable.

If you are creating object files:

```
g++ -g -c sfw.cpp -o sfw.o
g++ -g -c main.cpp -o main.o

g++ -g sfw.o main.o -o prog
```

### MSVC:

If you are using a compiler directly, then just add `sfw.cpp` or `sfwl.cpp` to the list of files that you are compiling:

```
cl /Zi /EHsc /Feprog-vc.exe sfw.cpp main.cpp
```

Note: /Zi means add debug information to the executable.

If you are creating object files:


```
cl /EHsc /Zi /c sfw.cpp /Fo:sfw.obj
cl /EHsc /Zi /c main.cpp /Fo:main.obj

cl /Zi /EHsc /Feprog-vc.exe sfw.obj main.obj
```
