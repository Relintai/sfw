SFW - Simple Framework - Lite Version - https://github.com/Relintai/sfw

Simple c++ app / game framework inspired by the single file c game engines 
and libraries, especially [FWK](https://github.com/r-lyeh/FWK).

**Modules**: Core

COMPILE
====================================================================================

$FILE_Compilation_No_Renderer$

CORE
====================================================================================

Use <code lang=C++>SFWCore::setup();</code> to initialize the library.
This is necessary as some components (Like PoolVector, and StringNames.) need additional setup.

Use <code lang=C++>SFWCore::cleanup();</code> to de-initialize the library.

Also note that if you don't use classes that doens't rely on this you can get away by not calling it.

There are a few remaining classes that were omitted from this document (Like allocators, hashers etc.), 
as you will normally won't need them. (If you do, you will likely just need to rread the source anyway.)
